## SHAPE America Standards

Note that we may want to add obstacle course and tag games more directly into the unit to address some of these standards.

Summary of the [SHAPE America grade-level outcomes](https://www.shapeamerica.org/standards/pe/upload/Grade-Level-Outcomes-for-K-12-Physical-Education.pdf) this unit most directly supports:

* Standard 1: Movement. This curriculum focuses on the locomotor skills in Standard 1. Non-locomotor (balance and stability) and manipulative skills can be layered on if desired. The core learning outcomes we address are:
  * Level 1 (grades K-2): Locomotor skills. Jumping.
  * Level 2 (grades 3-5): Mature locomotor skills. Pacing while running. Mature jumping patterns. Combines jumping and locomotor skills.
* Standard 2: Concepts, principles, strategies and tactics related to movement and performance
  * Level 1: Personal and general space; pathways, shapes and levels; speed and direction.&#x20;
  * Level 2: Space, pathway combinations, speed/endurance/pacing, applies to strategy in game situations. Applies strategies and tactics in chasing and fleeing activities, offensive and defensive strategies and tactics. (Note these last are relevant if we add tag games more directly into the curriculum; pacing relevant for larger orienteering races; pathway relevant if we add the right obstacles to the orienteering course.)
