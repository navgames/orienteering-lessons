{% tab title="Delivery" %}
1. Run the boundary.
2. Explore within the boundary to find checkpoints or Animal-O
3. Learn about the orienteering map from the teacher. Compare it to the picture map. Tell the teacher how to orient it. Describe, and run to and from, features the teacher points out on the map. Show map locations of the checkpoints you found while exploring.
4. Learn the map symbols.&#x20;
5. Pair up. Each pair gets a symbol-O clue sheet and the corresponding animal clue sheet.&#x20;
6. Visit checkpoints matching the symbols. Check with the animal clue sheet.&#x20;
7. Discuss with your partner what you each did well and what you could have done better.
8. Repeat with the other courses.

{% tab title="Reflection" %}
* How are the two maps different?&#x20;
* Which symbols were easier/harder to remember? Why?
* How did you work together?
