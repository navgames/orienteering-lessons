### Lesson

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Goals" %}
* <mark style="color:orange;">Use an isometric (picture) map to navigate a course.</mark>&#x20;
* <mark style="color:orange;">Pairs self-check the code (animal) at each checkpoint.</mark>&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">Complete the activity without teacher prompting. (S3.E2.3)</mark>&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">Cooperate and learn with others. (S4.E4, S4.E3)</mark>&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">Work independently & safely. (S4.E6)</mark>&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">Describe positive social interactions from PE activities. (S5.E4)</mark>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Delivery" %}
1. Explore within the boundary to find checkpoints or Animal-O
2. Learn about the picture map from the teacher. Tell the teacher how to orient it. Describe, and run to and from, landmarks the teacher points out on the map. Explore to find an animal checkpoint and show where it is on the map.
3. Pair up; take a picture map and a matching animal clue sheet.&#x20;
4. Follow the course shown on the map. Your partner checks you are at the right checkpoints, using the animal clue sheet.&#x20;
5. Take on a harder challenge: do the course faster, from memory, in reverse order, and/or by yourself.
6. Do a different course by yourself.
7. Help another student who is having trouble.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Reflection" %}
* What is unusual about a picture map? How was it helpful in locating checkpoints? How might a different kind of map have been more helpful?
* What landmarks did you use?
* How did you work with your partner?
* How did using the picture map help you make a mental map of the space?
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Extensions" %}
* (See challenges in the delivery section.)
* Pair students and have each instruct the other to find the checkpoint nearest a particular landmark.
* Ask students to name the checkpoint near specific landmarks from memory.
