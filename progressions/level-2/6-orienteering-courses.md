{% tab title="Delivery" %}
1. Pair up and orient the map with your partner.
2. Agree on the route you’ll take before beginning the course.
3. Visit each checkpoint in order. Compare the code to make sure you’re at the correct checkpoint.
4. Do the course individually several times to increase your speed.&#x20;
5. Do the course in reverse order and without a map.
6. Help fellow students who are having trouble by giving them hints and teaching them how to read the map.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Reflection" %}
* How did you determine which way to go for each checkpoint?
* What shortcuts between checkpoints did you find?&#x20;
* If you were at a wrong checkpoint, how did you figure out where you needed to go instead?
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Extensions" %}
* Divide the students into teams and have them run the course as a relay race, with each team member tagging the next member on completing the course.&#x20;
* Challenge students to run to three checkpoints in order without a map.
