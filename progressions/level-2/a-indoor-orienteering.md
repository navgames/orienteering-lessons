# A - Indoor Orienteering

> "Today we will be doing a regular orienteering course using a map"

_\*\*\* Resolve the map - we have both a full-court and half-court map. Create maps for single cone map and orientation. Think about how orient bball map - what landmarks. Full court has blue and orange. Half court should be easier and may not need landmarks. Generally throughout the curriculum think about how they check their location without SPORTident\*\*\*_&#x20;
