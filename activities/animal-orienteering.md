## Summary

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Summary" %}
Participants search for pictures of animals scattered throughout the space. This activity builds familiarity with their surroundings, and begins to develop spatial memory. The manner in which they look for the animals progresses from easiest (”Go find all the animals in any order”), to difficult challenges (”Find these five animals, in this order, from memory, without pictures in the space”). This is also an introduction to the timing system, where they learn how to beep checkpoints, download their information, and clear their cards when they start again.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="O Goals" %}
Orienteering involves finding checkpoints in sequence, and a firm understanding of where things are relative to one another in the surrounding area

- Observe the environment and find checkpoints
- Use a clue sheet (animal strip) to complete an orienteering course. 
- Check codes (animal pictures) at each checkpoint. 
- Spatial memory: Improve speed by remembering checkpoint locations. 
- (If working with a partner): teamwork

{% tab title="Standards" %}

SHAPE America:

- Demonstrate locomotor skills. (S1.E1, S1.E2) 
- Participate, learn, follow rules. (S3.E2, S4.E1, S4.E3, S4.E5)

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Target Audiences" %}
This range is typically from JK-5th grade (\~4-11 years old), although some variations are encouraged for participants at the outer edges of that range. This activity targets kids who are developing their spatial capacities, and for those who like simple scavenger hunts.Orienteering involves finding checkpoints in sequence, and a firm understanding of where things are relative to one another in the surrounding areaOrienteering involves finding checkpoints in sequence, and a firm understanding of where things are relative to one another in the surrounding areaOrienteering involves finding checkpoints in sequence, and a firm understanding of where things are relative to one another in the surrounding areaOrienteering involves finding checkpoints in sequence, and a firm understanding of where things are relative to one another in the surrounding areaOrienteering involves finding checkpoints in sequence, and a firm understanding of where things are relative to one another in the surrounding area

## Delivery

### Set-up and Clean-up

Spread the animal checkpoints throughout the space. 
Try to place checkpoints at distinct landmarks as often as possible (benches, trees, etc.). 
Place "Check", "Start" and "Finish" markers. 

If you do not have time prior to the activity to set up, then
incorporate set-up into the activity, by having the participants place
the checkpoints. 

Similarly, if you do not have time to pick up at the end of the
activity, assign checkpoints to participants to collect.

### Step-by-step

Note that the Explore and Find activity can be done prior to this
activity.

Point out some of the checkpoints in the field. For younger children,
we show a picture of each animal and ask the participants to move or
make a noise like the animal. We ask participants to look around for
the traffic cones that mark the checkpoint locations. If any animal
pictures are visible on those cones, we point out one as an example. 

Participants need to find the animals in a specific order. Show them an animal sheet, and explain they must go from top to bottom. Using the sheet as an example, ask them to identify the first animal they must find. Then the second, third, etc.
When participants begin this game after finding all the animals, quiz them again as you pass out the sheet to ensure their understanding.

There are several levels of difficulty to the animal sheets. 

- Number of Animals: Start participants on the shortest (fewest animals) sheets. Move them up to longer sheets as they complete 2+ of the previous level of difficulty.
- Repeat the first course that they do, but ask them to do it faster. That does not mean they have to move more quickly, but rather, because they now know where the animals are, they will be able to travel more directly to the correct checkpoints. If you are timing them, you can tell them their time at the end of the course, and rely on them to remember that time to compare it to the second round.
- Repeat the same course, but this time hold up the clue sheet and ask
the participants to do it from memory. They may take as much time as
they need before starting to look at their sheet to memorize the order
of animals. Leave the clue sheet near the Start so they can come back
and refer to it if they need to. The teacher can bring attention to
participants who are using the spatial pattern of checkpoints, and not
just memorizing the sequence of animals.  

Participants may always choose to repeat certain animal courses to improve their time.


### Sample script

"Our challenge today will be finding animal checkpoints throughout the space. 

"You will receive one of these clue sheets."

Show one of the 5-animal sheets. 

"Your challenge is to find these five animals, in order from top to
bottom. 
If you have this clue sheet, which animal do you find first? Second?
Third?" 

Make sure they can name each animal.

"Always start your course by going to the Check (Yellow Light for Get Ready) and
then the Start (Green Light for Go). After you visit all 5 animal
checkpoints, go to the Finish (Red Light for Stop)."

### Assessment

### Reflection

- What was the hardest part of this activity? Why?
- How did you remember where each animal was hiding?
Were some animal courses easier/harder? Why might that be?
- Where is the Lion? The Penguin? (etc) How do you remember where they
  are?
- Which checkpoint is closest to the Octopus? Which is furthest away from
  the Dog? Which is beyond the Elephant? Looking from here, which
  checkpoint is to the right of the Sheep? Etc.
- (If participants worked in pairs or groups) How did you work together? What strategies did you use to be successful as a team? 

### Reaching all learners

For participants with limited mobility or access to terrain, one or more of the courses can be placed entirely on accessible trails or walkways. 

Have participants work in pairs. 

This activity allows participants to go at their own pace, completing as many courses as is comfortable for them.


## Variations

- Have participants do this activity in pairs. This opens up a number of possibilities. Participants who need more help can get it from their partner. Participants often devise strategies to work together to do the course faster. For example, they may pass off the SI card mid-race so that one person can rest while the other is running. They may have a good strategy for communicating the next checkpoint and checking they are in the right place. Leave time to talk with the participants about how they worked together.
- Keeping track of course completion and/or times
  - Have a grid on a whiteboard, with participants’ names down the left and the course names along the top. Place a checkmark or write in the time for each successfully completed course. This gives a visual of the class progress and can be motivating to participants.
  - For older participants (grades 3-5), have them write down their times on their own small whiteboard or paper on a clipboard. 
- If there is time, move the checkpoints to new locations and do the activities again.
- Have the participants draw a map of the locations of checkpoints.
- White board game to introduce maps:
  - Split participants into teams and give them equal amounts of poly spots. 
  - Draw a simple map of the area to introduce maps to the kids. Draw a pattern on the whiteboard and have the kids copy it with the spots. 
  - Frame it as a teamwork activity, NOT a competition of which team does it quicker.
  - Alternative: the teacher will ask the kids how to do the pattern and handles the spots themself.
- _Note: this should be written up as a separate activity_ Cover the pictures of animals on each checkpoint. Can they still complete the courses based on their memory of where each animal is? 
  - Covering the pictures: This is easier with a small-scale geometric layout of the checkpoints, which makes it easy for the teacher to quickly cover the pictures. Alternatively, you may ask the participants to each cover one checkpoint. A piece of cloth and a clothespin works well to cover pictures attached to traffic cones.
  - A good sequence is to put participants in pairs, have them do one 5-animal clue sheet 3 times (the second time for speed and the third time from memory), then cover the pictures and have them repeat the same sheet from memory. Then, give them a new clue sheet, which will have animals on it whose position they do not know. They will need to confer with other teams who did have that animal in order to successfully complete the course. This is a great social-emotional and communication activity.

### Notes/FAQ
Some participants will progress much more quickly than others,
especially among younger groups. It helps to have a 3rd person
available to help provide additional assistance to any participants
who are struggling. It is also very likely that some participants will
not make it all the way through the entire progression. This is not an
issue, and any participants who do make it all the way to the end can
help other participants who are struggling.

Participants in the last class can help pick up the materials at the end.
