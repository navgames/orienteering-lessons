## Summary

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Summary" %}
Participants search for pictures of animals scattered throughout the space. This activity builds familiarity with their surroundings, and begins to develop spatial memory. The manner in which they look for the animals progresses from easiest (”Go find all the animals in any order”), to difficult challenges (”Find these five animals, in this order, from memory, without pictures in the space”). This is also an introduction to the timing system, where they learn how to beep checkpoints, download their information, and clear their cards when they start again.

{% tab title="O Goals" %}
Orienteering involves finding checkpoints in sequence, and a firm understanding of where things are relative to one another in the surrounding area

* Observation&#x20;
* Spatial Memory&#x20;
* Speed&#x20;
* Teamwork

{% tab title="Target Audiences" %}
This range is typically from JK-5th grade (\~4-11 years old), although some variations are encouraged for participants at the outer edges of that range. This activity targets kids who are developing their spatial capacities, and for those who like simple scavenger hunts.Orienteering involves finding checkpoints in sequence, and a firm understanding of where things are relative to one another in the surrounding areaOrienteering involves finding checkpoints in sequence, and a firm understanding of where things are relative to one another in the surrounding areaOrienteering involves finding checkpoints in sequence, and a firm understanding of where things are relative to one another in the surrounding areaOrienteering involves finding checkpoints in sequence, and a firm understanding of where things are relative to one another in the surrounding areaOrienteering involves finding checkpoints in sequence, and a firm understanding of where things are relative to one another in the surrounding area
