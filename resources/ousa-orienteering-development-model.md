## Introduction

The Orienteering Development Model follows the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee’s[ TeamUSA American Development Model](https://www.teamusa.org/About-the-USOPC/Programs/Coaching-Education/American-Development-Model), (ADM) which “help\[s] Americans realize their full athletic potential and utilize sport as a path toward an active and healthy lifestyle. The model utilizes long-term athlete development and quality coaching concepts to promote sustained physical activity, athlete safety and age-appropriate development with the aim of creating a positive experience for American athletes across all levels of sport.”  A key component of this model is the emphasis on play and having fun in the early stages of introduction to sport, in our case, orienteering.

The Development Model consists of 5 Key Principles, 4 Key Outcomes, and 5 Developmental Stages.

### Key Principles

The ADM suggests that quality sport experiences should incorporate five key principles to help keep more Americans engaged in sport:

1. Universal access to create opportunity for all athletes
2. Developmentally appropriate activities that emphasize motor and foundational skills
3. Multi-sport participation
4. Fun, engaging and progressively challenging atmosphere
5. Quality coaching at all age levels

### Key Outcomes

By creating early positive experiences for all athletes, the ADM will help keep more children engaged in sport longer with four clear outcomes:

1. Grow both the general athlete population and the pool of elite athletes from which future U.S. Olympians and Paralympians are selected
2. Develop fundamental skills that transfer between sports
3. Provide an appropriate avenue to fulfill an individual's athletic potential
4. Create a generation that loves sport and physical activity, and transfers that passion to the next generation

## Stages

The ADM is comprised of five stages designed to create a healthy sport experience and support an athlete’s advancement based on their physical, mental and emotional level, and potential for growth.&#x20;

In adapting the ADM for orienteering, we asked a few fundamental questions:

1. How does the ADM relate to how we understand orienteers developing over a lifetime?
2. What are strengths in our community that we want to maintain?
3. What are some habits not aligned with the ADM that we want to redirect towards more effective, inviting practices?

Orienteering USA’s (OUSA) Orienteering Development Model has five stages, all centered on the orienteering community.  The verbs that describe each stage invite the reader to think of orienteering as an activity with broad applications and possibilities; a traditional event with White through Blue courses is but one path.  Each stage builds on the next as a slow, deliberate approach to mastery by emphasizing community engagement and individual growth and reflection.  Beginning orienteers discover technical and physical aspects of orienteering through games, fun activities, and play - even as adults.  The experience of play and group engagement invites participants to hone their skills and participate in more traditional orienteering formats, but also to explore new ideas and transfer them to further development of the sport.  As individuals become more engaged, they become more specialized in their focus and more deeply involved in the community.  The overarching goal of this model is to provide a healthy, forward-thinking approach to the progression of orienteering development, both as individuals and as a living community.\


OUSA’s goal is for anyone interacting with this framework to use it as a guide rather than a rulebook.  We believe that the progression of stages defined below and principles of the ODM are a strong, safe approach that anyone can implement.  As a community, we will thrive by constantly finding new approaches to implement these principles while keeping orienteering engaging and fun.  We hope the community will consider the ideas proposed in this model as a means not only to further develop those in the sport today, but to promote orienteering as a sport for those who will discover it tomorrow.

### Stage 1: Experience, Explore, Play&#x20;

Age: 0 - up&#x20;

Focus: Safety, Experience, Relationship, Location, Direction&#x20;

Description: In this stage of development, the focus is on introducing a person to orienteering. The terms experience, explore and play describe the mood of the type of activities that should be offered at this level. Experience refers to all the basic aspects of the sport. The goal here is to give a new person a wide variety of simple experiences that make the sport fun, such as punching a control, running through terrain, and searching for things. Explore is designed to introduce a person to orienteering opportunities for them to discover capacities that they did not know they had, and to find new areas to explore or re-discover an area with a new perspective. Play describes the medium that these activities should be approached from. In play, a person is free to engage at whatever level possible; it naturally invites problem-solving and strategy, imagination and engagement, without over-intellectually processing. Experience, Explore and Play are designed to work together for a fun holistic introduction to orienteering. \

### Stage 2: Interact, Develop, Challenge

Age: 6 - up&#x20;

Focus: A place to build from&#x20;

Description: In Stage 2, individuals who like orienteering move from experiencing and exploring to participating in regular skill and capacity development, forming a basis for future orienteering training. Interact has multiple applications, including interacting with other people in the sport, with a variety of games and exercises, and with maps. Those just experiencing the sport (Stage 1) are testing the waters; in the second phase, they are interacting with orienteering and orienteers in a way that forges a long-lasting connection. Activities and exercises should include a variety of types of interaction to build these connections. Develop takes the “explore” in Stage 1 further. In exploring, individuals discover certain capacities to navigate and move through terrain. The “develop” phase transforms nascent abilities into working tools by building understanding of relationships between terrain and map to identify the processes that, when repeated correctly, result in success. Challenge builds from explore. In exploring, individuals discover new terrain; in challenge, they test their abilities to navigate in that terrain, such as by running faster through the terrain, trying an off-trail route, and generally pushing perceived limits. \

### Stage 3: Collaborate, Elevate, Train&#x20;

Age: 12 - up&#x20;

Focus: Team Orienteering&#x20;

Description: In this stage of development, the focus is on expanding the experiences and skills from Stage 2. Collaborate develops connections into relationships. This happens through group activities, pushing each other in training, sharing navigational experiences, refining technique as a group, and coming together as a team.  Elevate builds on Stage 2’s challenge, developing commitment to hard training. In the elevate phase, participants build orienteering ability through regular physical training, more challenging technical training, stronger interaction with the community, and self-discipline. Train refers to repetition and increased time practicing orienteering. As with anything, it takes a significant amount of time to reach a level of competence and ultimately mastery.  Entering Stage 3 orienteers are able to finish an intermediate course. Mature stage 3 orienteers train often enough to be competent and confident in their ability to complete an advanced orienteering course.\

### Stage 4: Participate, Master, Lead&#x20;

Age: 15 - up&#x20;

Focus: Contributing as a member of the orienteering community

Description: As orienteers attain advanced-level competence, individual goals, abilities and temperaments will lead to specialization.  Participate builds on collaborative relationships from Stage 3 and reflects different interests, as some broaden their orienteering interests, perhaps through developing skills in different disciplines, or developing expertise in course design, mapping, or putting on events (4a) and others seek a narrow focus of competing at the elite level (4b).  Lead reflects the opportunity for increased responsibility as experienced orienteers step forward to organize others in their area of specialization.  Master refers to achieving a skilled level of practice, marked by independence, self-confidence and self-efficacy: a model for others to emulate.

### Stage 5: Inspire, Support, Share&#x20;

Age: All &#x20;

Focus: Giving back&#x20;

Description: For some, orienteering will become a life-long passion worth sharing with others, and they will become the mentors who encourage others to grow.  Inspire builds on the Lead focus from Stage 4 by encouraging others at all levels to experience, develop, elevate, collaborate, participate, and master.  Support refers to many modes of giving back, such as coaching, sharing practices, organizing groups of experts, funding, and networking to create opportunities.  Share involves telling the stories of how orienteering has influenced one’s life path. &#x20;
